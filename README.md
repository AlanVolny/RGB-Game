RGB Game:

Try to figure out the pattern(s) between a series of lines of colors.

There are currently 6 levels (including level 0). To win a level you must correctly enter the next line of colors *n* times to win a round. Each level has three rounds, and to 'beat' a level, you must win each round.

Each round is generated from a level schema. While each round/playthrough of the level has different patterns, the patterns are related, and figuring out the schema / tendencies of each level is part of the game.

Technical:

Uses Python3 and nothing else, and for ease of use, is a single file.

General:

The levels can get quite confusing / ambiguous, that is partly on purpose! It's partially meant to be an exercise on weeding out false patterns, overcoming previous assumptions, and looking for new patterns.
